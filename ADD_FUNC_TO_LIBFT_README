To add additional functions to libft follow next steps:

1) Place your function in libft/src/additional/src

2) Include in function body may be
	# include "../../../includes/libft.h"
	Any other includes are not neccesary, but
	feel free to include other libraries or struct definitions in 
	appropriated header file
	libft/src/additional/includes/additional.h

3) Write your function prototype in libft/src/additional/includes/additional.h

4) To compile project with CLion,
	Write absolute path of your function to CMakeLists.txt
	at the end of the list in following format:
	libft/src/additional/src/your_function_name.c
